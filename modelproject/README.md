# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The AS-AD model** and serves to illustrate how the choice of different parameters affect the AS and AD curves and the resulting equilibrium. 

We set up the AS-AD model known from Macroeconomics and construct several interactive graphs to plot the equilibrium for different parameter values. We simulate the model and impose shocks to supply and demand to see how the economy converges back to equilibrium over time. We end the project by setting up an optimization problem for the central bank, where we find the optimal parameters to use in the Taylor rule to minimize a weighted sum of the variance of the inflation and the output gap.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages. Note that it is important to clone the notebook from GitHub and run it locally in order to see and use the interactive graphs.
