    "We then define a function to simulate the model with stochastic shocks to supply or demand. By setting supply_shock=True or demand_shock=True, a stochastic shock is imposed in period 1 (by drawing a number from the distribution of $x_t$ or $c_t$). The shock is removed for all subsequent periods, that is $x_t=c_t=0 \\quad \\forall t>1$. Thus, in the periods $t>1$, the remaining shocks in $v_t$ and $s_t$ is from their autoregressive nature, so the shocks die out naturally over time.

Looking at the graph to the right, we see that following a demand shock, it takes around 70 periods (given the parameters used) to reach convergence, following a supply shock, it takes around 50 periods and if we impose both a shock to demand and a shock to supply, it takes around 70 periods.

We have simulated the model and imposed shocks to supply and demand to see how the economy converges back to equilibrium over time. We ended the project by setting up an optimization problem for the central bank, where we found the optimal parameters to use in the Taylor rule to minimize a weighted sum of the variance of the inflation and the output gap."
